## What is it?

This is a simple navigation bar (with Bootstrap theme). You can define the minimum number of page to be displayed. You can also activate Previous and Next buttons and / or First and Last buttons.

![Navigation Bar](https://github.com/lionelrepellin/paging-with-entity-framework/blob/master/navbar.png "Navigation Bar")

## Points of Interest

- Web App using ASP.NET MVC 4 with N-Tier architecture:
  - Data access layer
  - Business layer
  - Domain layer (Entities)

- Paging with Entity Framework 6

- Create a navigation bar from scratch with [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) theme
  - Each button type is customizable

- Use [Unity](http://www.asp.net/mvc/overview/older-versions/hands-on-labs/aspnet-mvc-4-dependency-injection) to register ErrorContext and ErrorService for dependency injection

- Unit testing with [Visual Studio Unit Testing Framework](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Studio_Unit_Testing_Framework) (MsTest.exe)

- Use [Moq](https://github.com/Moq/moq4) to mock ErrorContext. The database will not be used for tests.

- [Glimpse](http://getglimpse.com/) to view SQL queries and many other things
  - run the app, navigate to /glimpse.axd and click "Turn Glimpse On".

## Requirements

- SQL Server Database
- .NET Framework 4.5 (works with 4.0)
- Visual Studio 2013 Express

## Quick start

- Download the last release
- Put your database settings into Web.config
- Create table with App_Data/CreateTable.sql
- Insert a lot of data into the table with App_Data/Data.sql
- Run the Web App from Visual Studio with F5 !

## Projects description

#### Paging

The main logic of the navigation bar. Be careful the navigation bar is auto adaptive. You can put this into an assembly and use it in your projects using Bootstrap.

You can play with the constants (```MAX_PAGE_TO_DISPLAY``` and ```PAGES_AROUND_CURRENT```) in NavBar.cs but the unit testing may be broken.

```
Paging
├── Buttons
│   ├── Button.cs
│   ├── First.cs
│   ├── Last.cs
│   ├── Next.cs
│   ├── Page.cs
│   └── Previous.cs
└── NavBar.cs
```

#### Paging.Tests

Some unit testing for the navigation bar. I hope every cases have been tested.

#### PagingWithEntityFramework

The main project who drives all actions. Look at especially these files:

```
PagingEntityFramework
├── App_Data
│   ├── CreateTable.sql
│   └── Data.sql
├── Controllers
│   └── HomeController.cs
├── Helpers
│   └── CustomHelpers.cs
├── Model
│   └── ErrorModel.cs
└── Views
    └── Home
        └── Index.cshtml
```

#### PagingWithEntityFramework.Business

A very simple business layer. No particular comment.

#### PagingWithEntityFramework.DAL

The data access layer. I used inline queries and mapped entities to retrieve all data from database.

#### PagingWithEntityFramework.Domain

Juste some DTO - nothing special here.

#### PagingWithEntityFramework.Tests

Unit testing for ErrorService.


```
PagingEntityFramework.Domain
├── Entities
│   └── Error.cs
├── ErrorResult.cs
└── SearchCriteria.cs
```

## Contoso University project

These two projects seem to do the same thing (paging with EF6, MVC4/5 and navigation bar) but what if there are million lines in the database ?
With Contoso and PagedList nugget package you retrieve all lines each time and display only a few lines per page. The application could be slow and maybe you can have a timeout. I think this is not the right way to do.

This is why I prefered to make my own paging system with two SQL queries:

- the first to retrieve only the wanted range of lines
- the second to get the total number of lines in the table (used for paging)
